// pseudocode:
// i have my html and elements
// my ui has been created?
// create json data for the views
// need an event listener / click handler
// obtain the json data
//      using fetch? - callback function?
//      json data is received as a string - need to convert to a js object
//          parse method?
// make a new variable that can hold the new html data for each view
// loop through objects that represent the information/state?
//      with their corresponding html elements
// could increment the index of the information stored in arrays to change content displayed
// contents of the objects will add to that new variable
// new html view would be updated and rendered by manipulating the dom?
//      update using document.getelementbyid?
