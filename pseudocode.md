# Pseudocode

## SMAC LIST:
1. Understand the problems
2. Break down the issues into smaller parts so that it's easier to comprehend what should happen in the code.
3. Consider wireframes and atomic design that's involved
4. Think about state being used.
    - (What data structures and/or algorithms do we need to use?)
5. Pseudocode!

## Brainstorm/Initial Thoughts:
- this is a single page app
    - meaning there will be one single card/frame where the elements within will change as the user goes through the app
- need to analyze the visual previewl that shows the change from one page to another
